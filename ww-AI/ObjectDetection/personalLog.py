# This is Personal notes so I can repeat my work from the future

#How i set up my Project:
    # set up virtual environment:
    # python -m venv venv

    #Activate the venv:
        # .\venv\Scripts\activate
    #If no permissions: 
    # Open powershell as admin and run: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned 
    # I turned the execution policy off once i went back and re ran the previous command and opened the virtual environment.

    # pip install torch torchvision torchaudio // Pytorch is a NN library we used in year 2

    # pip install ultralytics
