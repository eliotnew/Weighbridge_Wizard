# This code will train an object detection model from the images found in "./Images" and the Annotations found in "./Annotations". I annotated using "makesense.ai".
# I will use Yolo v8s because of it's lightweight and fast object detection ability.
# Detected objects will be used to then export and identify text values within the number plates.
