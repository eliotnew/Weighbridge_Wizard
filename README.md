Overview 
WeighBridge Wizard is a proof of concept project that re-imagines freight and cargo management software for the use of weighbridge clerks in the workplace.
It uses current research and design approaches with the goal of innovating in a sector that only emphasises pure functionality with little consideration for UX (user experience).  

Key Goals of the WeighBridge Wizard Project:  
* To Deliver a software product appropriate for operating a weighbridge  
* To ‘streamline’ work tasks by offering tools and using design patterns to reduce the amount of work required from operators  
* To Deliver a software system that is intuitive and does not require specialist knowledge to operate  
* To Make the role of weighbridge operator as accessible as possible to benefit business by increasing staffing opportunities
